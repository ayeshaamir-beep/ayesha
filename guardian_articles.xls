The one change that worked: I was lost in the infinite scroll – until a small ritual renewed my love of reading,,Books,"My ability to concentrate diminished as I spent more time on my phone. So I started to log and learn every new word I came across, and felt my brain begin to flex As a child I devoured books until my eyes blurred. When my GCSEs came around, I exercised the stamina of a monk, revising for hours without pause. But in recent years, I’ve watched that capacity for intense concentration dissolve into infinite scrolling on my phone. My attention span now contracts like a slug at the touch of a finger. Reading for pleasure feels less like nourishment and more like endurance training. And for someone who writes for a living, this is a professional hazard as well as something that made me sad. I wanted to restore that mental elasticity, to halt the brain rot. So, about a year ago, I made a small vow: every time I came across a word I didn’t know – whether in a novel, an article, or an overheard conversation – I would look it up and write it down. Nothing elaborate, no leather-bound journal or fountain pen. Just a running list kept, ironically, on my phone. Each week, I’d spend a few minutes reading the list back in an attempt to lodge the word into my memory. The list now spans almost 20 pages, and this tiny ritual has been quietly transformative. The payoff is less about peacocking with obscure adjectives – which, let’s face it, can make you sound insufferable – and more about the mental calisthenics of the ritual. Each time I look up and record a word, I feel a faint stretch, as though some neglected part of my brain is flexing again. Even if I never deploy “eidolon” in conversation, the very act of noticing, logging and revising it interrupts the slide into passive, semi-skimmed attention. There is also a journalling element to it – it functions as something of a diary, a record of where I’ve been reading, what I’ve been thinking about and who I’ve been listening to. Not that it’s an easy habit to keep up. It is often extremely impractical. If I’m reading on the tube, I have to stop mid-paragraph, pull out my phone and type “millenarianism” into my Google doc while trying not to elbow the stranger pressed against me. It can slow my reading to a maddening crawl. (The Kindle, with its built-in dictionary, is much kinder). And then there’s the revising (which I often forget to do), dutifully scrolling through my growing word-hoard like I’m preparing for a vocabulary test. Realistically, I incorporate maybe 5% of these words into my everyday speech. “Incorrigible” made the cut. “Lugubrious” too. But most of them remain like museum pieces – admired and catalogued but rarely handled. Still, it’s made my mind much sharper. I find myself reaching less often for the same tired handful of adjectives, and more often for something precise and muscular. Few things are more satisfying than unearthing the exact word you were searching for – like finding the missing puzzle piece that locks the picture into place. In an era when our devices siphon off our attention with merciless efficiency, it feels subversive to use mine as a tool for slow thinking. And it has given me back something I feared I’d lost – the pleasure of exercising a mind that, after years of slack scrolling, is finally waking up again.

Illinois governor vows to resist Trump administration ‘power grab’ after suing over national guard deployment to Chicago – live,Mon Oct 06 2025 21:05:28 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Trump administration,"JB Pritzker says Illinois will use ‘every lever’ to stop Trump’s use of military in state; federal judge says administration has two days to file a response and sets a hearing for Thursday Illinois sues Trump seeking to block deployment of national guard Karoline Leavitt said that the ruling from Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed federal judge, was “untethered in reality”. Immergut temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any national guard units to Oregon, saying that there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated the presence of national guard troops. Leavitt said that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Portland has been “really under siege by these anarchists”. “They have been disrespecting law enforcement. They’ve been inciting violence,” she added. “We are appealing that decision, as you know, we expect a hearing on it pretty quickly, and we’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this.” Leavitt went on to criticize Democratic leaders throughout the country, like JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom, for pushing back against the administration’s use of federal troops in blue cities. “Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place? They should be concerned about this. They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night, and the president all he’s trying to do is fix it,” the press secretary said. Voting is officially underway in California, the final step of lightning speed campaign to temporarily redraw the state’s Congressional districts. Proposition 50, known as the Election Rigging Response Act, was brought by Governor Gavin Newsom and California Democrats to offset Texas’s gerrymander, drawn at Donald Trump’s behest, that aims to safeguard Republicans’ fragile House majority next year. Unlike Texas and Missouri, where the Republican legislature approved a new map carved up in their favor, the effort in California will be decided by voters. Ballots have been mailed and the “yes” and “no” campaigns are in full swing. Polling suggests the yes campaign has the edge in the blue state that has been tormented by Trump since his return to office. Proponents have put the president at the center of their campaign, arguing that it is the best chance Democrats - and the country – has to put a check on Trump’s second term. Opponents argue that the new maps – designed to help elect five more Democrats to Congress – disenfranchise the millions of Republican voters in the state, while dismantling the work of the state’s independent commission, long considered a gold standard in fair map-drawing. While surveys consistently find that voters prefer independent redistricting and do not trust politicians to control the process, Newsom and Democrats have argued that their plan is both temporary and necessary to respond to Trump’s “powergrabs” in red states. The measure asks voters to amend the state constitution to adopt a new congressional map for 2026 through 2030. Election Day is 4 November. Michael Ellis, the deputy director of the CIA, unexpectedly removed a career lawyer who had been serving as the agency’s acting general counsel since January and appointed himself to the position, The New York Times reports. Ellis, who was involved in a number of controversies during President Trump’s first term, is keeping his role as the agency’s second-highest official while assuming responsibility for the agency’s top legal decisions. The reason behind his move remains unclear, but it has raised concern among current and former intelligence officials, according to the Times. President Donald Trump on Monday said that he would be open to striking a deal on Affordable Care Act subsidies that are at the heart of the government shutdown fight.
 But he also noted that “billions and billions” of dollars are being wasted, nodding to arguments from conservatives who do not want the health subsidies extended.
 “We are speaking with the Democrats,” Trump said, adding: “some very good things” could happen.
 Trump, who had been teasing layoffs for the last several days, said that if a Senate vote later Monday to reopen the government fails, “it could” trigger mass firings.
 “It could,” he said. “At some point it will.” A CBS News/YouGov survey shows that more Americans blame President Trump and congressional Republicans for the government shutdown than congressional Democrats. According to the poll, 39% of US adults say Trump and the GOP deserve most of the blame, compared to 30% who fault Democrats and 31% who place equal blame on both sides. A majority (52%) disapprove of how Trump and Republicans are handling the shutdown, while 49% disapprove of Democrats. Social Security Administration commissioner Frank Bisignano was named to the newly created position of CEO of the IRS today, making him the latest member of the Trump administration to be put in charge of multiple federal agencies. As IRS CEO, Bisignano will report to Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who currently serves as acting commissioner of the IRS, the Treasury Department says. It is unclear whether Bisignano’s newly created role at the IRS will require Senate confirmation. The Treasury Department said in a statement that Bisignano will be responsible for overseeing all day-to-day IRS operations while also continuing to serve in his role as commissioner of the Social Security Administration. JB Pritzker, Illinois’ Democratic governor, said today that the federal immigration agents have “terrorized” people in his state in recent months. “They aren’t receiving any orders from Trump to cease and desist their aggressive behavior. Remember, they answer only to Trump, not to the people of Illinois,” Pritzker said. “Their plan all along has been to cause chaos that and then they can use that chaos to consolidate Donald Trump’s power. They think they can fool us all into thinking that the way to get out of this crisis that they created is to give them free rein.” Addressing reporters today, Illinois governor JB Pritzker said today that he plans to use “every lever” to resist the “power grab” from the Trump administration to quell protests in Chicago by deploying national guard troops. The state has now filed a lawsuit to block the president’s move to federalize troops. Earlier, a federal judge did not block the deployment immediately, but has given the justice department two days to respond in writing to the state’s temporary restraining order motion. The next hearing is set for Thursday. Per my earlier post, noting that the Chicago mayor has signed an executive order which prevents federal immigration agents from using city property for immigration staging, the White House has responded, calling the move “a sick policy” that “coddles criminal illegal alien killers, rapists, and gangbangers who prey on innocent Americans”.  Donald Trump has announced that all “Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks” coming to the US from other countries will be subject to a 25% tariff starting 1 November. The White House criticized a Trump-appointed judge’s ruling, which temporarily blocked the deployment of national guard troops from Oregon and California. At a press briefing today, Karoline Leavitt said Judge Karin Immergut’s decision was “untethered in reality”, and said the administration was hopeful that the ninth US circuit court of appeals would rule in the president’s favor. Immergut said there was no evidence that persistent protests outside the immigration facility in Portland constituted an “invasion” – which could allow Trump to federalize guardsmen. The White House said that the facility is “under siege” by “anarchists”. In the midwest, Illinois has sued the Trump administration to block the deployment of hundreds of national guard troops to the streets of Chicago. In the lawsuit, leaders in the state say that Trump is using a “flimsy pretext”, which alleges an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in a Chicago suburb needs protecting as protests outside the building over Trump’s immigration crackdown continue. A reminder that over the weekend, the president sought to federalize up to 300 members of the Illinois national guard, despite the objections of the Democratic governor JB Pritzker. Trump sent another 400 from Texas, which Republican governor Greg Abbott has said he authorized. It is the sixth day of the government shutdown, and both parties continue to trade barbs over who is to blame. Congressional republicans say and the White House say that the ball is in the Democrats’ court, to pass a “clean” funding bill, and tackle healthcare negotiations once the government reopens. Meanwhile, Democrats say that their colleagues across the aisle have stonewalled any attempts at compromise. Earlier today, Karoline Leavitt said that any layoffs would be an “unfortunate consequence” of the shutdown, again laying blame at Democrats’ feet. The Senate will hold votes later today on the dueling stopgap funding bills, which are set to fail … yet again. The House of Representatives remains out of session, after Republican speaker Mike Johnson said that he wouldn’t be calling lawmakers back to Capitol Hill until the Senate advances the House-passed extension, known as a continuing resolution. The supreme court rejected Ghislaine Maxwell’s challenge of her criminal conviction for recruiting and grooming minors who were sexually abused by her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking crimes. Two lower federal courts have ruled that a plea deal Epstein struck in 2007, which protected his co-conspirators, didn’t extend to Maxwell’s federal conviction. Beyond the beltway, delegations from Israel, Hamas and the US began negotiations in Egypt today. The White House said that it hopes for a swift release of all remaining Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners so that a lasting peace deal can be reached in the region. The cause of a huge fire at the beachfront home of a South Carolina judge who had reportedly been subjected to death threats is being investigated by state law enforcement investigators. The blaze at the home of Diane Goodstein – a Democrat-appointed circuit court judge – erupted on Saturday, sending three members of her family to the hospital, including her husband, a former state senator. However, Goodstein, 69, was walking her dogs at the time the blaze erupted at the three-story home in the luxury gated community on Edisto Beach in Colleton county. A spokesperson for the South Carolina state law enforcement division (Sled) confirmed it was investigating a fire in the county. “The investigation is active and ongoing. More information may be available as the investigation continues,” a Sled spokesperson told FITSNews. For his part, John Kittredge, the South Carolina chief justice, told the outlet: “At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Sled chief Mark Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security.” Goodstein, who has served on the state judicial bench since 1989, in September issued a temporary injunction on the release of the state’s voter files to the Trump administration-led US justice department. Goodstein’s ruling was later publicly criticized by an assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon. The division has been at the forefront of efforts to acquire information, including names, addresses, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, of more than 3 million registered voters under an executive order targeting “non-citizen voter registration”."
Mount Everest hikers describe ‘extreme’ conditions as huge rescue effort continues,2025-10-05T18:35:47.000Z,Mount Everest,"At least 200 people still stranded after unseasonally heavy snowfall during China’s Golden Week holiday Trekkers have described facing “extreme” conditions after an unseasonable snowstorm during one of China’s busiest holiday weekends stranded hundreds of people on Mount Everest, prompting a massive rescue effort. Chinese authorities said about 350 people had made their way down but at least 200 remained stranded at the Everest Scenic Area, to the east of the mountain, on the Tibetan side of the border. Crowds of tourists had travelled to the region for “Golden Week”, an eight-day holiday period in China. But Chinese authorities, which control the Tibetan Autonomous Region, said heavy snowfall had hit the area on Friday and Saturday night, trapping hundreds of people at campsites at an elevation of more than 4,900 metres (16,000ft). “It was the most extreme weather I’ve ever faced in all my hiking experiences, without question,” Dong Shuchang, a Chinese trekker, said on Weibo, describing a “violent convective snowstorm on the eastern slope” of Everest. “I looked up in the middle of the night and saw that the snow had nearly covered the top,” said another trekker on Xiaohongshu. “It was the first time I truly felt the fear of being buried alive.” One Chinese trekker said their group had been “too scared to sleep” on Saturday as snow quickly piled up around their tents, forcing them to clear it every 90 minutes. They decided to descend on Sunday as the weather worsened. “On the way, we met our guide’s father, who had come looking for him. That’s when we learned the snow was heavy in the valley, too; villagers, unable to contact their children on the mountain, were extremely worried.” The northern and eastern side of Everest is more accessible than sites on the Nepal side of the border, and draws high numbers of visitors for less technical trekking, without summiting the peak. Photos and video posted online showed tents buried in snow, and lines of trekkers walking through waist-high drifts to get down the mountain. “The snow was very deep, and the trail extremely slippery. Trekkers stumbled frequently – some fell, others were bumped by yaks,” said one, who added that all safely descended and were picked up by bus. By Sunday afternoon, about 350 people had reached Qudang, a small town about 30 miles away from the Tibet-side base camp of Everest, “in good health”, state media reported. At least 200 more were still stranded, but had been contacted, the reports said. Jimu News reported that hundreds of rescuers had gone up the mountain to help people and clear snow from blocking the way out. There was little official reporting or updated information about the rescue effort on Monday. It was also not clear if the weather had affected anyone on the northern side of Everest, also in Tibet. The region is tightly controlled by the Chinese government, and journalistic access restricted. The weather also appears to have affected local communications, with calls to local businesses not connecting. Several trekkers said power was out in Qudang when they arrived. October is a peak season for the area, with usually clear and mild weather, but Chen Geshuang, one of 18 members of a trekking group that made it back to Qudang, said that the weather this year was “not normal”. “The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly.” The local tourism authority said ticket sales and entry to the Everest Scenic Area were suspended from Saturday. Neighbouring countries were also hit by extreme weather. Heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday in Nepal.

US supreme court declines to hear Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal of sex-trafficking conviction,,Ghislaine Maxwell,"Jeffrey Epstein associate was sentenced in 2022 to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking and related crimes The US supreme court has declined to hear an appeal from the Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell of her sex-trafficking conviction. The decision brings an end to Maxwell’s legal effort to have her 2021 conviction on sex-trafficking charges overturned – and leaves presidential clemency as her only option for early release from a 20-year prison sentence handed to her in 2022. “We’re, of course, deeply disappointed that the Supreme Court declined to hear Ghislaine Maxwell’s case,” Maxwell’s lawyer, David Oscar Markus, said in a statement to CNN. “But this fight isn’t over. Serious legal and factual issues remain, and we will continue to pursue every avenue available to ensure that justice is done.” The decision also leaves Maxwell, 63, as the only person to be convicted on charges related to Epstein’s two-decade sex-trafficking operation, despite mounting pressure from across the US political spectrum for other alleged co-conspirators – or clients of the conspiracy – to be brought to justice.
 In a contentious decision earlier this year, the FBI and justice department said they had “labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession”. And, the agencies also said: “It is the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”The memo provoked a political firestorm from lawmakers and Epstein survivors , both demanding further accountability. Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general, subsequently interviewed Maxwell in a Florida prison. Audio recordings and transcripts of the meeting were also released, but yielded little new information. She was also transferred to a lower-security federal facility in Texas. Maxwell’s appeal to the US supreme court centered on an argument that she was protected by a 2008 non-prosecution agreement made between Epstein and Florida prosecutors that covered co-conspirators.But Maxwell was not named in the controversial deal that saw Epstein – who died in detention in 2019 while awaiting trial – agree to plead guilty to Florida state charges of solicitation of a minor. He was handed a lenient 13-month sentence in a Palm Beach county lockup and required to register as a sex offender. Monday’s US supreme court ruling follows a decision by the New York-based second US circuit court of appeals last year that found Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement in Florida did not bind prosecutors in New York – and it let Maxwell’s conviction and sentence stand. The decision by the supreme court to deny her appeal was issued without comment. It also offers a reprieve to Donald Trump, who has been under pressure from disclosures by a congressional oversight committee looking into the case and has struggled to contain a scandal over the president’s past friendship with Epstein.In September, the committee released content from Epstein’s 50th birthday album, complete with a sexually suggestive entry attributed to Trump that the White House has claimed is fraudulent. Trump later filed a defamation claim against the Wall Street Journal – which first reported on the greeting. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the White House would welcome expert handwriting analysis and called the Epstein case generally “a hoax” meant to distract from the administration’s achievements during Trump’s second presidency. But critics say the Trump administration has failed to fulfil a promise to release all of the federal government’s documentation on Epstein. He has also stoked controversy by saying he is “allowed” to give Maxwell a pardon or commute her sentence under his presidential powers – although he has also maintained “it’s something I have not thought about”. The Epstein-Maxwell conspiracy continues to swirl through corridors of power and society. In September, Peter Mandelson, British ambassador to the US, was abruptly recalled after leaked emails showed his friendship with Epstein continued long after the financier’s Florida guilty plea. Mandelson called Epstein his “best pal” in one exchange. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, later said he would “never” have appointed Mandelson to be US ambassador if he had known the full details of Mandelson’s relationship with the convicted sex offender. Starmer said Mandelson had been properly vetted before his appointment. Sources close to Mandelson say that his dismissal, coming days before a lavish state visit to the UK by Trump and US first lady Melania Trump, had earned Starmer “a bitter enemy”. Lauren Hersh, national director of World Without Exploitation, a group representing the rights of sex-trafficking victims, said on Monday’s decision: “We are obviously happy to see the denial of Ghislaine Maxwell’s appeal.” Hersh’s statement said jurors “spoke loud and clear about how, for decades, Maxwell caused such devastating harm to so many women and girls”. “We’re heartened that she was rightfully not given leniency for her heinous crimes.” More details soon …"
Gaza flotilla members allege beatings and insults in Israeli detention,,Israel,"Some of those held say guns were pointed at them, they were threatened with dogs and deprived of sleep International activists, journalists and lawyers deported from Israel after attempting to breach the 16-year maritime blockade of Gaza as part of a humanitarian flotilla have alleged being subjected to brutal physical and verbal abuse by Israeli forces during their detention. The alleged abuses included sleep and medication deprivation, beatings, having automatic rifles pointed at their heads, dogs set upon them, having to sleep on the floor, being subjected to insults and being made to watch footage of the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. “I was beaten from the moment we entered the port until the very end,” said Saverio Tommasi, an Italian journalist. “Blows to my back, blows to my head – and they [the Israeli soldiers] laughed, laughed at all of it. Anyone who failed to keep their eyes down was punished with a hit to the head.” Israeli forces intercepted all the boats of the Global Sumud flotilla (GSF), carrying more than 400 people including parliamentarians and the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg, last week. Most of the people were held at Ketziot, a high-security prison in the Negev desert used primarily to detain Palestinians whom Israel accuses of involvement in terrorist activities. Israel’s foreign ministry has dismissed all claims of mistreatment of members of the flotilla as “brazen lies”, posting on X: “All the detainees’ legal rights are fully upheld.” The national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said he was “proud” of the way staff behaved at Ketziot. He said in a statement on the activists: “They should get a good feel for the conditions in Ketziot prison and think twice before they approach Israel again.” Rafael Borrego, a Spanish activist and lawyer, told Reuters: “At any time that any of us called a police officer, we risked that seven or more fully armed people entered to our cell, as they did on mine, pointing us with weapons at our heads, with dogs ready to attack us, and being dragged to the floor. This happened on a daily basis.” The Australia and New Zealand branch of the Global Movement to Gaza, part of the flotilla, said the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had notified the family of one participant that he had reported being assaulted during the interception of his vessel, receiving injuries to his shoulder and ribs. It said the DFAT had been told the man was later attacked while in prison, slapped in the face, mocked and verbally abused, denied clean water and kept awake as guards shouted at him throughout the night. Ada Colau, the leftwing former mayor of Barcelona, said on her return to Spain on Sunday night that the prison yard by her cell had been decorated with a huge photograph of a bombed-out Gaza, with a caption in Arabic that read: “Welcome to the new Gaza.” She said it showed that the jail was “the prison of a fascist state”. She said that when “we asked for a doctor, we were told that that was for humans”. Lorenzo D’Agostino, an Italian journalist, told the Guardian there were crew members who had urgently needed medication. “The Israelis ignored them,” he said. “When we all protested, they came in wearing riot gear, set dogs on us and aimed the laser sights of their automatic rifles at our heads.” He added: “When they stripped us of our shirts and of Palestinian symbols like the keffiyeh, they stamped on them forcefully.” D’Agostino and several other members of the flotilla said Israeli forces appeared to single out Thunberg for harsher treatment than the others. “I saw with my own eyes that they draped an Israeli flag over her while soldiers took selfies with her. Greta is a strong and courageous woman, but during detention she looked deeply shaken,” D’Agostino said. An email sent by the Swedish foreign ministry and seen by the Guardian confirmed that the activist had been forced “to hold flags” and had been “detained in a cell infested with bedbugs, with too little food and water”. The Israeli foreign ministry statement said Thunberg “did not complain to the Israeli authorities about any of these ludicrous and baseless allegations – because they never occurred”. The campaigner arrived on a flight to Greece on Monday, among 171 people Israel said it had deported. Speaking to the media, she said: “Let me be very clear; there is a genocide going on in front of our very eyes, a live-streamed genocide on all of our phones.” When journalists asked her about the alleged abuses, Thunberg chose instead to speak about the plight of the Palestinian people. “I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me,” she said. “But that is not the story. What happened here was Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent, attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes.” Monday’s expulsions brought the total number deported to 341, from 479 detained. The first of four Scottish people on the flotilla returned home to Glasgow on Monday. Margaret Pacetta, 72, described the detention in Israel as “absolute hell”. Pacetta, who has a broken leg, said the Israeli authorities took everything off her and made her remove her clothes in front of a man. She told a crowd who had gathered at the station to greet her: “They took all my meds … my inhalers and my nebuliser, they eventually gave the nebuliser back but threw the medicine for it away. They took my glasses off me and my hearing aids. They ripped my necklace off my neck and my watch. “They took everything. They took my T-shirt off me, they stripped me and opened the door and there’s a guy standing staring in.” Twenty-seven Greek nationals including a leftwing MP, Peti Perka, were also returning home on Monday after Athens’ foreign ministry announced it would dispatch a specially chartered plane to southern Israel’s Eilat-Ramon international airport. Greece’s centre-right government has faced mounting criticism over its hesitation to criticise Israel, with opposition parties and relatives of the activists accusing the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of prioritising the two countries’ “strategic alliance”. The Greek foreign ministry lodged “a strong written protest” on Friday in which it called on Israel “to promptly complete the required procedures [of repatriation] and to respect the rights of the citizens involved”, but opponents noted it was only issued after complaints of official indifference by the activists’ relatives. Stopping short of naming Ben-Gvir, who was filmed taunting the activists as they came ashore, the ministry criticised “the unacceptable and inappropriate behaviour of an Israeli minister directed against Greek citizens”. Meanwhile, a new flotilla that set sail from Turkey is making its way toward Gaza and is about 200 nautical miles from the territory. It is carrying about 250 people including doctors, nurses and journalists on a ferry converted into a floating hospital.
